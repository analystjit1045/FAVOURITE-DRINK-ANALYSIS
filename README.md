EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS ABOUT WHICH DRINK IS MOST POPULAR IN WHICH COUNTRY
#RECOMMENDATION :
1. Alcohol Consumption Awareness: Countries with high overall alcohol consumption, such as Grenada, Belarus, Czech Republic, Ireland, and Germany, should consider implementing awareness campaigns and educational programs to promote responsible drinking and highlight the potential health risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption.

2. Alcohol Taxation and Regulation: Countries with high beer, wine, or spirit servings might consider reviewing their alcohol taxation policies and regulations. Appropriate taxation and regulation can help discourage excessive consumption and generate revenue for public health initiatives.

3. Targeted Intervention for Spirits Consumption: Countries with high spirit servings, such as Haiti, Grenada, Guyana, and Belarus, should consider implementing targeted interventions to address the potential risks associated with excessive spirit consumption. These interventions could include stricter regulations, public awareness campaigns, and support programs for individuals struggling with alcohol addiction.

4. Data Quality Improvement: Some of the queries highlighted potential data quality issues or inconsistencies. For example, the presence of zero values for all alcohol types in certain countries raises questions about the accuracy and completeness of the data.

5. Outlier Analysis: The queries identified several outliers, such as countries with exceptionally high or low alcohol consumption levels. It is recommended to conduct a thorough analysis of these outliers to understand the underlying factors contributing to their extreme values. This analysis could provide valuable insights into cultural, socioeconomic, or policy-related factors influencing alcohol consumption patterns.
